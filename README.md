Using LiuggioKnpMenuExtensionBundle
===================

Welcome to LiuggioKnpMenuExtension  - creating menus is VERY fun again!


The objective of this bundle is to create (Knp)menu via the config file only(yml, xml),

using the Symfony2 event_dispatcher 

**Concept**

I had to develop a menu that would be extended and modified by other bundles.

see doc [Resources/doc/index.md](https://github.com/liuggio/KnpMenuExtensionBundle/Resources/doc/index.md)
